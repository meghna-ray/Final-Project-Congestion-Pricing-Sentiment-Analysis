# Intro to text analysis through python-Final Project

## Gauging public opinion regarding the introduction of congestion pricing policy in Manhattan, New York through text analysis. 

New York City is looking to reduce emissions, tackle congestion and increase investment in transit. It plans to achieve these 3 goals by introducing congestion pricing in the Manhattan region.This policy has faced equal amount of support and opposition from local stakeholders including local citizens, transit officials, the city and state government. This research project seeks to gauge public opinion regarding the introduction of congestion pricing by conducting a text analysis of news coverage by local publications on the topic.

Research Question: What is the sentiment of the local population on the proposed introduction of congestion pricing in New York, to reduce traffic in the Manhattan? 

Hypothesis: There is a mixed opinion regarding the introduction of congestion pricing, and there is most likely a relationship between the ideological leanings of the newspaper publication and its coverage of the topic. 

The project at hand seeks to run a preliminary text analysis on the coverage of congestion pricing by local news publications. Firstly, a sentiment analysis of the articles published by local publications on the topic will be conducted. This will help determine the presence of a link between ideological leanings and the tone of the articles, i.e., a positive or negative tone, published by them. This tone will be determined by the sentiment scores assigned to the articles. In addition, the frequency of words used by publications in their coverage of the issue will be analyzed to determine the presence of a link between the publication, the ideological leaning and the issues related to congestion pricing covered by them.
